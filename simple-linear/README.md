In this project,  using a dataset from IBM Object Storage ( located [HERE](https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/ML0101ENv3/labs/FuelConsumptionCo2.csv) )
a regression model was created to predict CO2 emissions.
The dataset contains model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.
